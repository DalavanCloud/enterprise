# FAQ

Commonly asked questions about the Serverless Platform.

### How do I setup CI/CD with the platform?
The framework supports an ENV var for the access key called `SERVERLESS_ACCESS_KEY`.
You can get an access key from the “secure” tab on the platform then you can set that env var in your CI/CD system.
