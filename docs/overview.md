# Overview

Serverless infrastructure is a new type of cloud infrastructure that auto-scales and charges you only when it's used.  If you embrace it to build your applications and business logic, you will reduce overhead, innovate more and move incredibly fast.

However, many teams and organizations don't know how to do serverless development, let alone cloud development.  We built the [Serverless Platform](https://www.serverless.com) to help them.  It includes everything teams and organizations need to practice serverless development safely, and deliver results faster than ever.

## Product Areas

The Serverless Platform currently contains three product areas:

### Serverless Framework

The serverless application framework.  Use it to build, deploy and update serverless applications across vendors.

### Serverless Dashboard

The serverless operations console.  Monitor, collaborate and secure your serverless applications.

### Event Gateway

The serverless integration infrastructure.  Connect your serverless applications and functions to your existing workloads and services.

Out-of-the box, the Serverless Platform features a hosted version of the Serverless Dashboard and a hosted version of the Event Gateway, all of which are run and operated by us, Serverless Inc.

You can also self-host the Event Gateway and plug it into the Serverless Platform.  This is a fit for you if your company has extra-sensitive data.  If this is of interest to you, inquire about it [here](https://serverless.com/enterprise/).

## Concepts

After multiple years of doing serverless development, we believe we've created the best possible abstractions for reasoning about serverless applications.  Here's what they are:

### Application



### Service
### Function
### Event
### Subscription
### Resource
### Component
