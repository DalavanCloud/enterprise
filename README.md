![Serverless Framework Enterprise Documentation](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.github.serverless/readme-serverless-enterprise-documentation.png)

While the Serverless Framework is an open-source CLI that makes it easy for individual developers to build and deploy serverless applications, the [Serverless Framework Enterprise](https://dashboard.serverless.com/) is a commercial SaaS solution that augments the Serverless Framework CLI with everything you need to operationalize serverless development across your teams and organization in an easy and open way.

This repo contains technical documentation to help you get started with the Serverless Framework Enterprise.
